                Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on because every individual in this world
                has their own style of writing. It is the capability of the computer to identify and understand
                handwritten digits or characters automatically. Because of the progress in the field of science and technology,
                everything is being digitalized to reduce human effort.
